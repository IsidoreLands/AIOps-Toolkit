## Goal: To Improve Our Capacity for Independent Action
This project is an experiment in improving our collective ability to comprehend and cope with a complex environment. Our success depends on a shared environment of high trust, where ideas can be rigorously challenged and synthesized without fear of personal attack. This document does not outline rules of etiquette; it defines the conditions necessary for our dialectic engine to function.

## The Challenge & Refine Process
Our process mirrors John Boyd's "Destruction and Creation" cycle.

1.  [cite_start]**Propose (Thesis):** Submit clear ideas, pull requests, or arguments intended to create a better "match-up with reality." 
2.  **Challenge (Antithesis):** Critique concepts, not people. Rigorous, good-faith dissection of ideas is required. Pointing out flaws is a valuable contribution.
3.  **Refine (Synthesis):** The goal is not to "win" an argument, but to arrive at a better solution. Acknowledge valid critiques to create a more robust outcome.

## Practical Examples
* **Valid Critique:** "This function works, but it lacks error handling for edge cases, which could cause a crash."
* **Invalid Attack:** "You're a sloppy coder; this is amateur work."
* **Valid Critique:** "I disagree with this approach. A different algorithm might be more performant here. Let me provide a benchmark."
* **Invalid Attack:** "Your ideas are always terrible."

## Enforcement
Personal attacks, harassment (e.g., repeated, targeted insults or threats), or other bad-faith arguments disrupt the creative cycle. Such actions will be addressed by project maintainers with the sole purpose of restoring an environment of high trust.

# This module will contain all functions related to interacting with Google Workspace APIs.
# It will be developed as part of VLOR loop ALCUIN-L001.

    (To be implemented)

    to authenticate with the Google Drive API, fetch the content of the
    Google Doc specified by doc_id, and return it as a plain text string.

    # --- IMPLEMENTATION STEPS ---
    # 1. Load credentials from the service account JSON file.
    # 2. Build the Google Drive API service object.
    # 3. Use the service.files().export_media() method to get the doc content.
    # 4. Decode the content and return it.
    # 5. Implement robust error handling.
    
    # Return a placeholder string for now.

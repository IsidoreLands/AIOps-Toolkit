## Your Contribution is a Hypothesis
[cite_start]A contribution to this project—whether code or documentation—is a hypothesis for a better "match-up with reality."  By submitting it, you are inviting the community to engage in a cycle of "Destruction and Creation."

## Process (OODA Loop)
1.  **Observe:** Spot a bug, a potential improvement, or a gap in documentation.
2.  **Orient:** Fork the repository. Analyze the existing code and concepts to understand the current state.
3.  **Decide:** In a new branch, create the code and/or documentation that represents your new hypothesis.
4.  **Act:** Submit a Pull Request to introduce your hypothesis for community review, debate, and synthesis.

## Standard Git Workflow
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AIOps-Toolkit.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AIOps-Toolkit.git)
cd AIOps-Toolkit

# Create a new branch for your feature or fix
git checkout -b feature/my-new-idea

# Make your changes and commit them with the -s flag
git commit -s -m "feat: Add new function for X"

# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/my-new-idea

# Go to the original AIOps-Toolkit repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request

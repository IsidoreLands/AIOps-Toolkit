# Placeholder Script: setup_google_service_account.sh
# Version: 1.0
#
# PURPOSE:
# This script is a placeholder to represent the manual process of creating
# a Google Cloud Service Account and its credentials. The actual steps must be
# performed in the Google Cloud Console by Admin Isidore.
#
# PROCEDURE:
# 1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console -> "IAM & Admin" -> "Service Accounts".
# 2. Click "CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT".
# 3. Name: "isidore-aiops-agent"
# 4. Grant access to the project if necessary (initially, no roles are needed).
# 5. Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE".
# 6. Skip granting user access.
# 7. Click "DONE".
# 8. Find the newly created service account, click the three dots under "Actions",
#    and select "Manage keys".
# 9. Click "ADD KEY" -> "Create new key".
# 10. Select "JSON" and click "CREATE".
# 11. A JSON file containing the service account's private key will be downloaded.
# 12. Securely transfer this JSON file to the AIOps droplet and save it as
#     '~/aiops_toolkit/gcp_service_account.json'.
# 13. Secure the file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/aiops_toolkit/gcp_service_account.json`

echo "This is a placeholder script. The actions described above must be completed manually."
echo "Once the 'gcp_service_account.json' file is securely in place, the 'google_tools.py' module can be developed."
